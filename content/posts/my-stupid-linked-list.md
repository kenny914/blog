# My First Stupid Linked List

Hi! I made a linked list. I have learned some things and I felt like sharing with the class that is my blog~

## What I Learned...

So I learned some C++ and how to make a Linked List (*obviously lmao*), but what else could I have learned? I learned the difference between a "Heap" and a "Stack".

### What Is A Stack?

A "Stack" is a region of memory that stores 

- Local Variables
- Function Paramaters
- Return Addresses

It operates in a LIFO order.

LIFO = Last In, First Out.

### What Is A Heap?

A "Heap" is a Larger Region of memory that is used for *Dynamic Allocation*. That means I decide to allocate and free memory basically.
